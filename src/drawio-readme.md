# draw.io Readme

## Purpose & reasoning

Some instructions and reasoning behind using draw.io.

For some of the previous images used in the Eiffel Community we have used
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), but for me I found
[draw.io](https://draw.io/) simpler. [draw.io](https://draw.io/) supports saving
the original file both as a `drawio` file and a `SVG`. I have chosen the `drawio`
format to signal the tool used to create the final `SVG`.

## Instructions for update and export

1. Open the `drawio` with the desktop version or online version of
   [draw.io](https://draw.io/)
1. Do the updates. **Note** When adding links I have chosen to tick the "Open in
   New Window" box not to forget this during export of the `SVG`. If you don't
   change the way links behave embedding the `SVG` in a HTML file will cause the
   link to open as a frame.
1. Save it
1. Do `File->Export As->SVG...`. Standard settings should work.
1. Test and see that your exported SVG works a it should. See
   [community.html](../community.html) for an example of use.
