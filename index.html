          The Eiffel protocol enables technology agnostic communication for CI/CD eco systems.<br />
          Eiffel is based on the concept of decentralized real time messaging providing traceability<br />
          and KPIs throughout your pipelines, across platforms.<br />

        <h1 class="section-heading">Why Eiffel?</h1>
        <p class="section-paragraph">Modern software production systems are more than just a build server. It is a shifting mix of functions and technologies, from issue trackers and test frameworks to environment managers and repositories. At the same time, software supply chains become increasingly complex, crossing organizational and geographical borders many times before resulting in the final software product. It is a world of interconnected and interdependent software pipelines.</p>
        <p class="section-paragraph">The Eiffel community applies the same architectural principles to this network of pipelines as to any other software design problem. The main part is the <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel">Eiffel protocol</a>, enabling technology agnostic event-based communication among the actors of the system. The <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community">community also provides services and plugins</a> for sending, storing, analyzing and acting upon those event communications.</p>
        <p class="section-paragraph">The Eiffel protocol and it's implementations lets you know at a glance what is up in your software production system and your supply chain, while providing rich extension points where others can hook into your pipeline with perfect upstream and downstream traceability.

        <p class="section-paragraph">To get into the concepts of the Eiffel protocol, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Zx84ecQ1jyGSc9709xrZg">Youtube channel</a> and watch the screen casts on what the Eiffel protocol is, and how it achieves its mission. If you're looking for examples of how to use it, try the Usage Examples provided in the <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel">protocol repository</a>.</p>
        <p class="section-paragraph">Keep in mind that Eiffel is designed to let you cherry-pick the parts that add value for you, while ignoring the rest. This goes for the protocol as well as for its implementations. Browse the <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel">protocol vocabulary</a> and the <a href="https://eiffel-community.github.io/eiffel-sepia">Sepia implementation architecture</a> to find what supports your critical use case, and then expand from there.</p>

        <h1 class="section-heading">History</h1>
        <p class="section-paragraph">The Eiffel protocol saw the light of day in 2012 as a protocol for large-scale software integration within Ericsson. In 2016 Ericsson made the initial contribution of the protocol to open source, and has since then been collaborating with the community to create open source implementations of it. Coming from the world of large telecommunications systems it was designed for scalability and high demands on traceability. At the same time, the design of the protocol and its implementations ensures that you can cherry-pick the parts that are relevant to you. This affords an easy-to-adopt yet highly flexible and scalable solution that will grow along with your needs.</p>
