        <h1>Agenda</h1>
        <p>
          The agenda is still being worked on, but we're gravitating
          towards these themes (partially dependent on the indicated
          interest of people who register):
          <dl>
            <dt>Improved source change events</dt>
            <dd>
              The current source change events model an abstraction of
              what goes on in a source code repository. This is
              sufficient for some use cases but can pose problems if
              you want a model that more closely matches
              reality. Let's continue the discussion around this and
              the concrete proposal in
              <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/issues/261">
                github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel#261
              </a>.
              That aside, with the current events there's no standard
              way of representing tags.
            </dd>
            <dt>Deployment events and DORA metrics</dt>
            <dd>
              What can we do with the experimental
              EiffelArtifactDeployedEvent
              (<a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/pull/322">github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel#322</a>)?
              Which DORA metrics can we cover with Eiffel?
            </dd>
            <dt>What is Eiffel and why should I care?</dt>
            <dd>
              Introduction to those who are new to Eiffel.
            </dd>
            <dt>Visualizations</dt>
            <dd>
              How can we use Eiffel to visualize CI/CD pipeline,
              either with generic solutions or highly specialized ones.
            </dd>
            <dt>Security, CVEs, and SBOMs</dt>
            <dd>
              How can Eiffel be used to address concerns related
              to security and software supply chains?
            </dd>
          </ul>

          The second day of the summit, June&nbsp;14, is adjacent to the
          <a href="https://www.software-center.se/event/rws_june2023/">Software
          Center reporting workshop</a>, and the afternoon of this day
          aims to cater to a wider audience of people who may not be
          familar with Eiffel in particular but is well-versed in the
          CI/CD space in general, possibly from the academic side.
