        <p class="centered-text">The vision for achieving our mission is three-fold:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A shared vocabulary and protocol for technology agnostic messaging between all actors in the pipeline.</li>
          <li>Data storage and analysis services providing a very high degree of traceability of what was done when, how, where, why and by whom for every software version, from commit to finished release candidate.</li>
          <li>Integrations with all relevant pipeline tools and services, allowing them to send, receive and act upon Eiffel messages.</li>
